### Detects motion in video

Able to identify moviong objects and place a box around them. Objects need to meet a size threshhold to avoid false positives. This
can be adjusted to only find objects that are of a certain size. Can give a summary of object movement times. 

**Possible future uses:**
Home made trail cam
- watches for movement and starts saving footage when movement is detected

Security cam

Nanny cam

Dashboard cam
- automatically turns on when car is moving
- have it shut off after extended period of no movement
